2. Run `rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` to execute the migration files. 
3. Run `rails test test/models`

### System tests

1. Open a command line terminal on the project root folder.
2. Run `rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` to execute the migration files.
- Run `rails test test/system/authentication_test.rb:4` to test the index page.

- Run `rails test test/system/authentication_test.rb:22` to test the sign in and sign out.
- Run `rails test test/system/events_managements_test.rb:4` to test the creation of an event.
